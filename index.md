# Drizzt Do'Urden - A man from downunder

## alone in the dark, hurt, the greatest fighter the world has ever seen

*brave
*loving
*silverhaired
*blackskinned

A man, born into a society which lives by everyone seeking only their own benefits, where slavery, wars and massacres are an everyday occurance. One man ... no. One drow seeks for the comradery and love, even if it means to leave what is known and to be hunted by his breathern.
